<h2 align="center">WHERE TO GO</h2>
<div class="wrapper" align="center"><p>Ghana is a country full of natural splendors, charming people and a vibrant culture. Depending on your length of stay in Ghana, make sure you allow yourself a chance to step out of the chaos of our beloved Accra and make your way towards the pristine beaches of the coastline (from the Volta region, the Greater Accra region, the Central region and the Western region). Explore and enjoy the colorful and lively fishing villages of Salt-pond, Cape Coast, Elmina and Takoradi to name a few main spots.</p></div>

<h2><strong>Weekend excursions (some few suggestions)</strong></h2><br>
<div style="width:auto; height:auto" align="left">
<p><img class="floatright imgsettings imggh2" alt="Image of the sunset in Ghana" src="http://www.volunteerwithdunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ws-sunset.jpg" /><h3><strong>Central Region</strong></h3><br>
While in the Central region, make your way to the <strong>Kakum National Park</strong> for a Canopy walk and experience the tropical forest at unprecedented heights, after which you can go see the crocodiles at <strong>Hans Botel Cottage</strong>.  A visit of the <strong>Cape Coast Castle</strong> or the <strong>Elmina Castle</strong> will provide you with an unforgettable learning experience of the slave trade era of the Gold Coast. <br><br>
After a wonderful day of exploring in Cape Coast, enjoy a relaxing and lively evening at <strong>Oasis Beach Resort</strong>, a small resort next to the Cape Coast Castle that provides good food, cheap rooms and entertainment.  It is a very popular stop for expats so you are bound to meet new friends with whom you can share stories and recommendations.  <br><br>
<h3><strong>Greater Accra</strong></h3><br>
When in Accra, make sure you visit <strong>Labadi Beach</strong>, a very popular spot on Wednesdays (Reggae Night) and on the weekends.  If you are interested in shopping and exercising your new negotiating skills, make your way to <strong>Makola Market</strong> and the <strong>Accra Art Centre</strong>.  These are massive markets where you can buy anything and everything.  <br>
On the way to Kasoa, just outside of Accra, you can enjoy a beautiful afternoon at <strong>Bojo Beach</strong> and <strong>Krokobite</strong>. Feel free to make it a weekend retreat and stay at <strong>Big Millys’</strong> backyard in Krokobite. <br><br> 
Just off the Accra-Aflao motorway, along the Volta River, you will find a nice beach town called <strong>Ada Foah</strong>. With the river on one side and the ocean on the other, Ada Foah is famous for water sports like swimming, sailing, fishing and boat cruises.

If you decide to go towards the East side of the Country, make sure to visit the Wli waterfalls located close to a city called Hohoe, in the Volta Region. You will be blown away by the beautiful view and the thousands bats lying on the side of the waterfalls.<br><br>
<h3><strong>In General</strong></h3><br>
One thing you will notice in Ghana is the omnipresence of music and dance.  Should you be interested in experiencing a great night of dancing, you have come to the right place.  There is no shortage of clubs and dance halls (there are too many to name therefore feel free to ask any of the staff and your news friends for any recommendations!) Ghanaians love their nightlife, although they are generally not big consumers of alcohol.  Generally a typical night will start very late (around 11pm) and will finish when the last person leaves the dance floor (6am). Ghana has many more activities to offer. We suggest that you bring along a Travel Book, look at some tourism websites or ask our team for more activities. </p>
